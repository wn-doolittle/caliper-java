IMS Global Caliper Analytics™ APIs are publicly licensed as Open Source Software via GNU General Public License version 3.0  GPL v3.
This license contains terms incompatible with use in closed-source software including a copyleft provision. 

IMS Global also makes available an Alternative License based on the GNU Lesser General Public License. LGPL v3 
Licensees (via the Alternative License) are required to be IMS Global members. Membership in IMS  is a commitment by a supplier to the IMS community for ongoing support for achieving "plug and play" integration.  IMS Membership dues pay for ongoing maintenance for the Alternative License to be applicable to updates to the Caliper Analytics APIs. The rationale for this dual-license approach and membership component is to help assure a requisite level of ongoing development, project management, and support for the software.
Licensees of IMS Global Caliper Analytics APIs are strongly encouraged to become active contributors to the Caliper Analytics project and other projects within IMS Global. Prospective licensees should understand that their initial base contribution and ongoing membership fees are insufficient to fully fund the ongoing development and maintenance of Caliper APIs and that voluntary contributions are the primary "fuel" ensuring any open source project's viability. Contributions can include development, bug fixing, bug reporting, performance analysis, and other aspects of the overall development process.

Contributor status at the "github" level will be individual-based. Contributors will need to sign an IMS Global Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that grants IMS Global a license to contributions.
